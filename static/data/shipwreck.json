Although no contacts were\r\nlocated within the radius, the Hydrographer notes that the position data in the AWOIS record is very\r\ninconsistent. The original reported position is located on shore at the southern tip of James Island. The\r\nrevised position in the AWOIS record is located 3,850m SW of the original position. Also, the closest\r\ncharted wreck PA is located 450 m south of the revised position. The hydrographer is assuming that\r\nthis is the corresponding charted feature, as a separate AWOIS number is not listed for it. The contact\r\nreferenced in this report appears to be a cabin cruiser, approximately 33 ft long, located 1,550 m WSW of\r\nthe revised position in the AWOIS record. Knowing that a small, submerged boat has the potential to\r\ndrift a significant distance due to currents in the area, the hydrographer believes this wreck to be the one\r\nreferenced in AWOIS 11,935.

Although the current feature does not lie within the 1850-meter search radius of another AWOIS item, #1814, the history for AWOIS 2729 indicates that a past hydrographer believed\r\nthat AWOIS 2729 may have been the wreck of AWOIS 1814 (the tug \"Thames\"), whose 1850-meter search radius (1) is centered 4240 meters to the northwest and (2) does not contain any wrecks. The current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate the past claim that the wreck of AWOIS 2729 is the wreck of AWOIS 1814 because (1) no diver investigation\r\nwas done and (2) the current feature does not precisely match the description of the tug \"Thames\" provided in AWOIS 1814's proprietary section; however, the current feature does closely match the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813 (believed to the tug \"Barataria\"), although the hydrographer can not definately say wether or not the current feature is indeed the wreck of AWOIS 1813 because no diver investigation was performed and another wreck also closely matches the description of AWOIS 1813 (RES 11\/30\/07).\r\n\r\n  MAR 9\/30\/82-R\/H--UNIDENTIFIED WK LOCATED BY SSS AT POS. 41-09-19.25N,  72-25-04.09W PROTRUDING 9.5 FT OFF BOTTOM IN 131 FT OF WATER.

Update AWOIS Item #2730 database position and depth (AWOIS database estimated depth was incorrect with a value of 79ft while raster chart 12354 (41st Ed., Apr.\/04) portrays the correct depth value of 123 feet.This feature is the least depth over a wreck that appears to be a submerged barge. The wreck was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500) and 100% MBES (RESON 8101). The wreck is 32.5 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located within the 200-meter search radius for AWOIS 2730 (a charted 123-foot reported non-dangerous wreck) and the 2000-meter search raduis for AWOIS 1813 (a charted wreck believed to be the tug \"Barataria\"). The history for AWOIS 2730 indicates that a past hydrographer believed that AWOIS 2730 may have been the wreck represented by AWOIS 1813; however, the current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate this claim since (1) no diver investigation was done and (2) the current feature does not correspond to the description of the Barataria included in the proprietary section of AWOIS 1813 (which describes a wreck 20.9 by 5.5 meters). NOTE: From the AWOIS descriptions, it appears the past hydrographer based his claim on knowing about only two wrecks. The current survey data show a total of five wrecks within or very near the search radii of AWOIS 1813, two of which (addressed in other feature reports) do indeed correspond to the AWOIS description (RES 11\/30\/07).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n DESCRIPTION\r\n  206  LORAN C RATES: 9960-W 14863.9; 9960-Y 43965.9.
