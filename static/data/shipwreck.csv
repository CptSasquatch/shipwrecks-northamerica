Hydrographer Recommendations:
Due to its extremely small size (17') minimal height (appx 53cm) and proximity to a much larger object(Chesapeake Light), the hydrographer recommends the obstn be removed from the chart and AWOIS 11436 be removed from the database.
Office Notes:
Concur with clarification. There are other, shoaler, outer-beam hits on the feature, but the current sounding was
chosen as the least depth because it is near nadir. Chart present survey soundings."

  H09743/78--PSR Item #1 was found by divers to be a dangerous sunken wreck, as charted.  Least depths were determined by diver-held lines, with the leas depth located at the southeast end.  The wreck lies at an angle of approx. 345T and appears to be approx. 120 ft. long.  Local residents confirmed the wreck to be a mine sweeper which sunk at the end of the Navel degaussing station pier.
  LNM50/75--The Point Jefferson lighted wreck buoy has been discontinued.  The wreck has moved inshore and is now located in lat. 47/45/28N, 122/28/06W in 34 feet of water.
  CL331/71--A sunken charted wreck at 47/45/27N, 122/28/03W was investigated on 25 Sept. 1970 by the USC&GS FAIRWEATHER launch FA-3 to verify its location and determine the least depth.  The wreck was located and a fix taken at the shoalest depth, 1.1 fathoms by hand lead, The top of the rest of the wreck was submerged about 2 fathoms.  The centerline of the wreck lies approx. N-S.  Inquiry of Mr. Al Wolfe at the US Navy Degaussing Station on the point, indicated that he believed the wreck was a 140 ft. mine sweeper.  Originally, parts of the wreck were exposed at minus tides, but he reported that it had not been visible recently.  Mr. Wolfe also reported that the pier charted insshore of the buoy near the wreck had been removed entirely, including stub pilong, etc.;  an investigation confirmed this.

  H11088--S-E906-BH-01;  Due to shoal water depths, the entire search radius for this item was not
investigated. Approximately 25% of the radius was covered with 200% SSS. Although no contacts were
located within the radius, the Hydrographer notes that the position data in the AWOIS record is very
inconsistent. The original reported position is located on shore at the southern tip of James Island. The
revised position in the AWOIS record is located 3,850m SW of the original position. Also, the closest
charted wreck PA is located 450 m south of the revised position. The hydrographer is assuming that
this is the corresponding charted feature, as a separate AWOIS number is not listed for it. The contact
referenced in this report appears to be a cabin cruiser, approximately 33 ft long, located 1,550 m WSW of
the revised position in the AWOIS record. Knowing that a small, submerged boat has the potential to
drift a significant distance due to currents in the area, the hydrographer believes this wreck to be the one
referenced in AWOIS 11,935. The hydrographer recommends ADDING a 53 Wk w/ danger curve at 38° 27' 43.75"" N, 076° 21' 54.32"" W, and retaining the wreck PA as charted. (PTT 9/29/06)."

SONARGRAMS DEPICT THE WRECK OF A LARGE SAILING VESSEL AS EVIDENCED BY IMAGES OF PROMINENT BOWSPRIT AND MAST STUBS.  ALSO CLEARLY SHOWN WERE THREE LARGE SQUARE CARGO HATCHES.  ALL THESE ATTRIBUTES PLUS THE SIZE OF THE WRECK (185.9 FEET)  AND LOCAL HISTORY (BELOW) INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE WRECK OF THE ""MAXWELL"".  DUE TO POOR VIS., NO DIVE OPS UNDERTAKEN.  ECHO-SOUNDER LD OF 52 FEET OBTAINED ON TIP OF BOWSPRIT IN LAT. 38-55-57.707N, LONG. 76-23-37,639W.   EVALUATOR RECOMMENDS RETAINING CHARTED DEPTH OF 50 FEET ON WRECK BUT REVISING TO PRESENT SURVEY POSITION AND DELETING NOTATION ""REP(1987)"" ON ALL AFFECTED CHARTS.  EVALUATOR ALSO CONSIDERS AWOIS NO. 4456 (DERRICK BARGE) AND AWOIS NO. 9424 (""MAXWELL"") TO BE THE SAME ITEM.

H12112 - The item is located at 37-46-54N 122-30-58W. A very small area of MBES data was collected within the 200m search radius of AWOIS item 50186. The area surrounding AWOIS 50186 contained significant shoals, rocks, and swift tidal currents, which did not allow for safe MBES survey operations. Hydrographer recommends no action be taken on the AWOIS item due to lack of coverage.

The wreck is approximately 21 meters long and 3-5 meters wide. The feature is located within the 2000-meter search radius of and closely matches the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813; however, the hydrographer is unable to definatively substantiate that the current feature is the wreck of AWOIS 1813 because no diver investigation was performed and another wreck (of the five located within or very near the search radius of AWOIS 1813) also closely matches the dimensions of AWOIS 1813. NOTE: Although two different wrecks closely match the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813, a recommendation addressing AWOIS 1813 is included in only the current feature report since a feature can be a secondary feature to only one primary feature."

OPR-B370-TJ-04-- Chart AWOIS Item #2729 non-dangerous sunken wreck, least depth known 122 feet, and text ""Wk"" at the present survey position in Latitude 41°09'19.290""N, Longitude 072°25'00.591""W.This feature is the least depth over a wreck that was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500). The wreck is approximately 23 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located 1.1 meters from the position of AWOIS 2729 and approximately 10 meters outside the 1850-meter search radius of AWOIS 1813. Although the current feature does not lie within the 1850-meter search radius of another AWOIS item, #1814, the history for AWOIS 2729 indicates that a past hydrographer believed
that AWOIS 2729 may have been the wreck of AWOIS 1814 (the tug ""Thames""), whose 1850-meter search radius (1) is centered 4240 meters to the northwest and (2) does not contain any wrecks. The current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate the past claim that the wreck of AWOIS 2729 is the wreck of AWOIS 1814 because (1) no diver investigation
was done and (2) the current feature does not precisely match the description of the tug ""Thames"" provided in AWOIS 1814's proprietary section; however, the current feature does closely match the length and width dimensions of AWOIS 1813 (believed to the tug ""Barataria""), although the hydrographer can not definately say wether or not the current feature is indeed the wreck of AWOIS 1813 because no diver investigation was performed and another wreck also closely matches the description of AWOIS 1813 (RES 11/30/07).

Update AWOIS Item #2730 database position and depth (AWOIS database estimated depth was incorrect with a value of 79ft while raster chart 12354 (41st Ed., Apr./04) portrays the correct depth value of 123 feet.This feature is the least depth over a wreck that appears to be a submerged barge. The wreck was located with 100% MBES (EM 1002) and developed with 100% SSS (KLEIN 5500) and 100% MBES (RESON 8101). The wreck is 32.5 meters long and 5 meters wide. The feature is located within the 200-meter search radius for AWOIS 2730 (a charted 123-foot reported non-dangerous wreck) and the 2000-meter search raduis for AWOIS 1813 (a charted wreck believed to be the tug ""Barataria""). The history for AWOIS 2730 indicates that a past hydrographer believed that AWOIS 2730 may have been the wreck represented by AWOIS 1813; however, the current hydrographer is unable to definitively substantiate this claim since (1) no diver investigation was done and (2) the current feature does not correspond to the description of the Barataria included in the proprietary section of AWOIS 1813 (which describes a wreck 20.9 by 5.5 meters). NOTE: From the AWOIS descriptions, it appears the past hydrographer based his claim on knowing about only two wrecks. The current survey data show a total of five wrecks within or very near the search radii of AWOIS 1813, two of which (addressed in other feature reports) do indeed correspond to the AWOIS description (RES 11/30/07).

 DESCRIPTION
 **** IN THE MID 1940'S, PROBABLY DURING A CHART RECONSTRUCTION AND INSET, THE OIL BARGE (IF EVER CHARTED), WAS DELETED FROM THE CHART AND THE SS JOHN WORTHINGTON  (AWOIS # 5020) WAS CHARTED.  A REASONABLE EXPLANATION IS THAT THE EAST BANK OF THE CHANNEL MIGRATED 50-100 METERS EAST WHICH PUT THE ONCE CLOSE INSHORE WRECK OF THE OIL BARGE (AWOIS #5016) OFFSHORE,  AT THE SAME TIME THE WORTHINGTON WAS BEACHED ON THE EAST SHORE IN 1945. (UPDATED 9/1999 RWD)

THIS MAY HAVE BEEN FILE I77-91  ADDRESSED IN LNM37/1991, AS DISCUSSED WITH MR. LEDET (TELCON 6/25/2001).  THE SURVEY PLOT IS ILLEGIBLE HOWEVER THE COVER LETTER STATES THAT ""NO SUNKEN VESSEL WAS FOUND...
